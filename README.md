## Laguages and Tools used
- HTML, CSS, JS (of course)
- cssnano, postcss and sass
- gulp

## How to set the workflow
Just fork or download the code and run
```
npm install
```
This will install all required modules
Then run
```
gulp
```
This will start watching scss and js files from source folder and also create a local server for live demo.
