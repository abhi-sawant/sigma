Our college's current website - [Click Here](https://sigma.ac.in/)

## Laguages and Tools used
- HTML, CSS, JS (of course)
- cssnano, postcss and sass
- gulp

## Libraries used
- [Slick](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick) For testimony carousel 
- [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) For scroll animations

## How to set the workflow
Just fork or download the code and run
```
npm install
```
This will install all required modules
Then run
```
gulp
```
This will start watching scss and js files from source folder and also create a local server for live demo.
