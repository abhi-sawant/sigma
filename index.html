        <h2>The Windows 11 app store is already more useful after just a week</h2>
        <p>Microsoft’s dysfunctional app store for Windows, the Microsoft Store, is finally improving under Windows 11.
            While there’s a UI overhaul and some speed improvements, the key change is allowing more apps into the
            store. In
            just the past week alone, some popular apps have started to appear in the Microsoft Store on Windows 11,
            making
            it more useful than before.

            OBS Studio, Zoom, Canva, WinZip, and Adobe Acrobat Reader have all made their way to the Microsoft Store in
            the
            past week, alongside Microsoft Edge browser extensions. These early additions, during a beta period for
            Windows
            11, are a promising start.

            The Microsoft Store is changing on Windows 11, and eventually Windows 10, to include any traditional desktop
            apps. Microsoft previously restricted developers to its Universal Windows Apps, before then allowing some
            desktop appas that were packaged to use its store for updates. Now any app can be part of the store, a move
            that
            aligns with the Windows Package Manager Microsoft released last year.</p>
